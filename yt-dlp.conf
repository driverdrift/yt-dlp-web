	# In nginx matching:
	# '=' (exact match) > '^~' (prefix with no regex override) > normal prefix match (longest match first) > regex (~ / ~*)
	# Regex matching has lower priority than longest prefix match, and '^~' is used to prevent regex from overriding a prefix match.
	# =========================================================================
	# NGINX LOCATION MATCHING PHASES (The "Rule of 4")
	# =========================================================================
	
	# PHASE 1: EXACT MATCH
	# If an exact match (=) is found, Nginx stops immediately.
	# Example: location = /login { ... }
	
	# PHASE 2: PREFIX SEARCH (The "Longest Match" memory)
	# Nginx searches all non-regex (prefix) locations. 
	# It finds the LONGEST match and "remembers" it for later.
	# IMPORTANT: It does NOT stop here unless the '^~' modifier is used.
	
	# PHASE 3: THE OVERRIDE (Regex Check)
	# Unless the longest prefix found in Phase 2 has the '^~' modifier, 
	# Nginx will check ALL regular expressions (~ or ~*) in the order they appear.
	# -> If a regex matches: Nginx uses it IMMEDIATELY and stops.
	# -> This is where the "Regex Hijack" happens.
	
	# PHASE 4: THE FALLBACK
	# If NO regex matches, Nginx goes back to the "remembered" 
	# longest prefix match from Phase 2.
	
	# =========================================================================
	# PRIORITY SUMMARY:
	# 1. Exact Match (=)
	# 2. Prefix with Stop (^~) [Prevents regex check]
	# 3. Regular Expressions (~ or ~*) [Order of appearance matters!]
	# 4. Longest Standard Prefix [The survivor if no regex matches]
	# =========================================================================
